I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from the Higher Institute of Computer Science and Information Systems with a Good grade from Cairo, Egypt in 2020. I trained at STS in Amman, Jordan for two months in 2018 in the field of web development, and I took a course in the field of web development in Cairo, Egypt for five months in 2019. I want to gain more and more information in this field and I would like to develop myself in my field of work and be better than before*
